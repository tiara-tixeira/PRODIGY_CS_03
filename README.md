# Password Complexity Checker
Overview
This project provides a tool to assess the strength of passwords based on predefined complexity requirements. The Password Complexity Checker ensures that passwords meet certain criteria, which improves security by encouraging the use of stronger, more secure passwords.

Features
Password Validation: Checks if a password meets the following complexity criteria:
Minimum length
Contains uppercase letters
Contains lowercase letters
Contains numbers
Contains special characters (e.g., @, #, $, etc.)
User Feedback: Provides feedback on the strength of the password and informs users about which criteria are met or missed.
How It Works
The Password Complexity Checker validates a password by evaluating it against a set of rules. Each rule must be satisfied for the password to be considered strong. Users receive feedback indicating whether the password is acceptable or if it needs to be improved based on the criteria.
